## TODO

### Website
- [x] Translate every page from old website to new website
- [ ] Integrate VHDL-93 section into each page
- [ ] Decide whether to support VHDL-93 or only VHDL-08 - I recommend both
    - [ ] Add and remove pages that are no longer relevant
- [ ] Reference specific sections of the LRM (Language Reference Manual) if possible
- [ ] Improve VHDL examples on every page
- [ ] Add better tags to every page
- [ ] Proofread every page to ensure grammatically correct
- [ ] Fix rouge's VHDL highlighter for underscores and other characters - their repo is [here](https://github.com/rouge-ruby/rouge)
- [ ] Find a permanent place to host website - possibly on a domain of it's own like vhdlref.com, vhdl.com, or ref.vhdlweb.com
- [ ] Dark mode? (I don't know if it's possible without using JS)

### Mobile App
- [ ] Test website and app on more devices, OS's, and web browsers
- [ ] Release Android app on F-Droid and Play Store
- [ ] Create iOS App to go alongside Android app
- [ ] Promote application to people who may find it useful and ask for feedback
