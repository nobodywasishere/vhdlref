</TABLE>

<P><TABLE BORDER=0 CELLPADDING=5>
<TR>
<TD VALIGN=TOP>Analysis</TD>
<TD>The syntax checking and compilation of a <b style="color:black;background-color:#ffff66">VHDL</b> design into a design library.</TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN=TOP>Architecture</TD>
<TD>A library unit associated with an entity which describes its internal operation or 
organisation. Multiple architectures may be defined for a single entity</TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN=TOP>Component</TD>
<TD>A definition of the interface to a sub-module, rather like a "socket", to
which an entity may later be bound.</TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN=TOP>Concurrent Statements</TD>
<TD>Statements within an architecture which execute concurrently in simulated time,
independently of their order.</TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN=TOP>Configuration</TD>
<TD>Defines the "binding" of each component instance to an entity, and each entity to an architecture.
Can be defined using a configuration library unit or from within an architecture.</TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN=TOP>Design File</TD>
<TD>A text file containing source code for one or more design units.</TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN=TOP>Design Library</TD>
<TD>A data structure containing analysed design units (library units).</TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN=TOP>Design Unit</TD>
<TD>A <b style="color:black;background-color:#ffff66">VHDL</b> module contained in a design file, consisting of the source
code for a library unit preceded by any required Library or Use clauses.
Analysis of a design unit defines the corresponding library unit in a
design library.
</TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN=TOP>Elaboration</TD>
<TD>The building of a simulateable model through the top-down binding of
its structural hierarchy, according to the configuration selected.
</TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN=TOP>Entity</TD>
<TD>A library unit which describes the external interface of a hardware module.</TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN=TOP>Function</TD>
<TD>A group of sequential statements which can be "called" from
different places in a model, reading one or more input parameters and
returning a single value.
</TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN=TOP>Library Unit</TD>
<TD>An analysed design unit. The five types of library unit are: entity,
architecture, package, package body and configuration.
</TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN=TOP>Overloading</TD>
<TD>The definition of multiple functions or procedures with the same
name, which operate on different parameter combinations or types.
</TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN=TOP>Package</TD>
<TD>A primary unit containing a collection of declarations and/or
specifications which may be used in other library units.
</TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN=TOP>Package Body</TD>
<TD>A secondary unit associated with a package, whose main purpose is to
contain the full code for any functions or procedures which have been
declared in the associated package. It may also contain declarations and
specifications which are explained in the Reference Guide section of
this document.
</TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN=TOP>Primary Unit</TD>
<TD>a library unit which can exist in a design library. The primary
design units are entity, package and configuration.
</TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN=TOP>Procedure</TD>
<TD>A group of sequential statements which can be "called" from different places in a model.
It may have parameters of modes in, out or inout.</TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN=TOP>Process</TD>
<TD>A concurrent statement which contains a collection of sequential statements and which
can interact concurrently with other concurrent statements.</TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN=TOP>Resolution</TD>
<TD>The determination of the value of a signal when it is simultaneously driven by more 
than one source.</TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN=TOP>Scope</TD>
<TD>The region of <b style="color:black;background-color:#ffff66">VHDL</b> code within which a declared item (e.g. a constant) may be used</TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN=TOP>Secondary Unit</TD>
<TD>A library init which defines a body associated with a primary unit
which has already been analysed into the same design library. The
secondary units are architecture (associated with entity) and package
body (associated with package).
</TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN=TOP>Sequential Statements</TD>
<TD>Statements which are executed in the order they are written, as with
"conventional" software languages.
