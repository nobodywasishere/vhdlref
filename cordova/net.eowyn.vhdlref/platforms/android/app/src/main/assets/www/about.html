<h1>About</h1>

<p>The purpose of this website is to provide a usable language reference for writing VHDL (VHSIC Hardware Description Language) in a way that is concise, direct, and easy to understand for as many people as possible.</p>

<p>This website was written with Jekyll and can be hosted on Github Pages. The design of this website is intended to be as simple and accessible to as many people as possible, so there are very few colors (only exception being code highlighting) and no JavaScript. The interface should be able to scale and be readable at most resolutions. If it does not work on your device, please submit an issue at the git repository listed below.</p>

<p>This website is distributed under the terms of the <a href="LICENSE.html">MIT license</a>, except for the archives listed below, which remain property of the original author(s). If you wish to help make this website better, learn about how the website works, or make your own version of it, the git repository is hosted <a href="https://github.com/nobodywasishere/vhdlref">here</a>.</p>

<!-- If the Github repository is gone, I'm sorry :( -->

<hr />

<p>This is a recreation of the VHDL reference website that was once hosted at www.truechap.demon.co.uk from around 2001 to 2005, when the website was shut down. That website is the earliest copy of the website I could find, which leads me to believ it’s creator, Dave Trueman, created the reference website (his website also hosted a reference sheet as far back as 1998 which only adds credibility to this).</p>

<p>The site was archived on vdlande.com until 2009 when that website was also shut down. There are archives of both of these sites on archive.org here:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20090801000000*/http://www.vdlande.com/VHDL/">vdlande.com</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20010301000000*/http://www.truechap.demon.co.uk/files/vhdl/">www.truechap.demon.co.uk</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Currently, there is also another copy of the site hosted at www.ics.uci.edu <a href="https://www.ics.uci.edu/~jmoorkan/vhdlref">here</a>. However, this archive is missing a few pages - specifically:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Configuration Declaration</li>
  <li>Library Clause</li>
  <li>Selected Signal Assignments</li>
  <li>Type Declaration</li>
</ul>

<p>and has a Google archive header at the top due to how it was archived. This is not a fault for the archive though; it is better that it was saved in any capacity than not at all.</p>

<p>This is not a direct 1:1 recreation as corrections have been made for spelling and grammar mistakes, and to switch to the Oxford comma. Also, additional information may be added to this website to reflect changes made in VHDL standards VHDL-08 and VHDL-19.</p>

<p>Due to this, I have also archived the original websites locally:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="websites/www.truechap.demon.co.uk/files/vhdl/"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">www.truechap.demon.co.uk/files/vhdl/</code></a></li>
  <li><a href="websites/www.truechap.demon.co.uk/files/vhdl.htm"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">www.truechap.demon.co.uk/files/vhdl.html</code></a> (preliminary reference sheet mentioned above)</li>
  <li><a href="websites/www.vdlande.com/VHDL/"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">vdlande.com/VHDL/</code></a></li>
  <li><a href="websites/jmoorkan/vhdlref/"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">www.ics.uci.edu/~jmoorkan/vhdlref/</code></a></li>
</ul>

<p>Be careful, I did not break the links to external websites or missing files.</p>
