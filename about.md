The purpose of this website is to provide a usable language reference for writing VHDL (VHSIC Hardware Description Language) in a way that is concise, direct, and easy to understand for as many people as possible.

This website was written with Jekyll and can be hosted on Github Pages. The design of this website is intended to be as simple and accessible to as many people as possible, so there are very few colors (only exception being code highlighting) and no JavaScript. The interface should be able to scale and be readable at most resolutions. If it does not work on your device, please submit an issue at the git repository listed below.

The website itself uses the MIT license, while all of the original information pulled from the archives listed below remains property of the original author(s). If you wish to help make this website better, learn about how the website works, or make your own version of it, the git repository is hosted [here](https://github.com/nobodywasishere/vhdlref).

<!-- If the Github repository is gone, I'm sorry :( -->

This is a recreation of the VHDL reference website that was once hosted at www.truechap.demon.co.uk from around 2001 to 2005, when the website was shut down. That website is the earliest copy of the website I could find, which leads me to believ it's creator, Dave Trueman, created the reference website (his website also hosted a reference sheet as far back as 1998 which only adds credibility to this).

The site was archived on vdlande.com until 2009 when that website was also shut down. There are archives of both of these sites on archive.org here:
* [vdlande.com](https://web.archive.org/web/20090801000000*/http://www.vdlande.com/VHDL/)
* [www.truechap.demon.co.uk](https://web.archive.org/web/20010301000000*/http://www.truechap.demon.co.uk/files/vhdl/)

Currently, there is also another copy of the site hosted at www.ics.uci.edu [here](https://www.ics.uci.edu/~jmoorkan/vhdlref). However, this archive is missing a few pages - specifically:
* Configuration Declaration
* Library Clause
* Selected Signal Assignments
* Type Declaration

and has a Google archive header at the top due to how it was archived. This is not a fault for the archive though; it is better that it was saved in any capacity than not at all.

This is not a direct 1:1 recreation as corrections have been made for spelling and grammar mistakes, and to switch to the Oxford comma. Also, additional information may be added to this website to reflect changes made in VHDL standards VHDL-08 and VHDL-19.

Due to this, I have also archived the original websites locally:
* [`www.truechap.demon.co.uk/files/vhdl/`]({{ 'websites/www.truechap.demon.co.uk/files/vhdl/' | baseurl }})
* [`www.truechap.demon.co.uk/files/vhdl.html`]({{ 'websites/www.truechap.demon.co.uk/files/vhdl.htm' | baseurl }}) (preliminary reference sheet mentioned above)
* [`vdlande.com/VHDL/`]({{ 'websites/www.vdlande.com/VHDL/' | baseurl }})
* [`www.ics.uci.edu/~jmoorkan/vhdlref/`]({{ 'websites/jmoorkan/vhdlref/' | baseurl }})

Be careful, I did not break the links to external websites or missing files.

Special thanks to:
* Dave Trueman for (possibly) creating the original reference website
* The creator of VDLANDE.com for archiving the website
* Dr. Jayram, Moorkanikara Nageswaran for creating their own archive of VDLANDE's archive, which is still online
* The Internet Archive for their numerous contributions to history and culture preservation
