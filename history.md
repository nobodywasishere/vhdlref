This is a recreation of the VHDL reference that was once hosted at www.truechap.demon.co.uk starting around 2001. The last archive of the website on archive.org was in 2005, so it is possible this is when the website was shut down, however due to the recent transfer of the [demon subdomain Vodafone](https://forum.vodafone.co.uk/t5/Other-broadband-queries/Anyone-else-affected-by-Vodafone-disabling-demon-co-uk-emails/td-p/2655220), it is possible the website was still up until May 2020. That website is the earliest copy of the reference I could find, which leads me to believe Dave Trueman was it's creator. His website also hosted a short reference sheet as far back as 1998, which only adds credibility to this.

A copy of the reference was archived on vdlande.com on or before 2009 (due to there only being one copy on archive.org, we can't be sure when it was archived). It is missing a few pages, specifically:
* Library Clause
* Selected Signal Assignments
* Type Declaration

There are archives of both of these sites on archive.org here:
* [vdlande.com](https://web.archive.org/web/20090801000000*/http://www.vdlande.com/VHDL/)
* [www.truechap.demon.co.uk](https://web.archive.org/web/20010301000000*/http://www.truechap.demon.co.uk/files/vhdl/)

Currently, there is also another copy of the reference hosted at www.ics.uci.edu [here](https://www.ics.uci.edu/~jmoorkan/vhdlref) (specifically this is a copy of the copy found at vdlande.com). However, this archive is also missing the pages listed above, and the page for "Configuration Declaration". It has a Google archive header at the top due to how it was archived, but this is not a fault for the archive; it is better that it was saved in any capacity than not at all. It includes a few VHDL reference PDFs that the original and vdlande.com did not.

This is not a direct 1:1 recreation as corrections have been made for spelling and grammar mistakes, and to switch to the Oxford comma. Also, additional information may be added to this website to reflect changes made in VHDL standards VHDL-08 and VHDL-19.

Due to this, I have also archived the original references within this website and in the git repository:
* [`www.truechap.demon.co.uk/files/vhdl/`]({{ 'websites/www.truechap.demon.co.uk/files/vhdl/' | baseurl }})
* [`www.truechap.demon.co.uk/files/vhdl.html`]({{ 'websites/www.truechap.demon.co.uk/files/vhdl.htm' | baseurl }}) (preliminary reference sheet mentioned above)
* [`vdlande.com/VHDL/`]({{ 'websites/www.vdlande.com/VHDL/' | baseurl }})
* [`www.ics.uci.edu/~jmoorkan/vhdlref/`]({{ 'websites/jmoorkan/vhdlref/' | baseurl }})

Be careful, I did not break the links to external websites or missing files - these are direct copies of what is available on archive.org.

Special thanks to:
* Dave Trueman for creating the original reference
* The creator of VDLANDE.com for archiving the reference
* Jayram Moorkanikara at UC Irvine for creating their own archive, which is still online today
* The Internet Archive for their numerous contributions to history and culture preservation
