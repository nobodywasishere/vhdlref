The purpose of this website is to provide a usable language reference for writing VHDL (VHSIC Hardware Description Language) in a way that is concise, direct, and easy to understand for as many people as possible.

This website was written with Jekyll and can be hosted on Github Pages. It utilizes the Just the Docs theme.

<!-- The design of this website is intended to be as simple and accessible to as many people as possible, so there are very few colors (only exception being code highlighting) and no JavaScript. The interface should be able to scale and be readable at most resolutions. If it does not work on your device, please submit an issue at the git repository listed below. -->
